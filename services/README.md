# Services

1. [Front End](frontEnd/)
1. [Back End](backEnd/)

## Quickstart

The quickstart to get up and running with both for a usable UI would be:

```bash
cd frontEnd/ && npm run build:prod && cd ../backEnd && npm start
```

And then visit [`localhost:8081/build/index.html`](http://localhost:8081/build/index.html)
